# M-PINN
Martingale Augmented-Physics Informed Neural Network

The M-PINN folder contains two main subfolders:

1. B-S PIRL uses the PIRL (Physic Informed Residual Learning) method to numerically solve the B-S model from 1D to nD, as well as a comparison of layer and hidden modifications.

2. M-Code presents the authors' proposed improved method M-PINN (or M-PIRL) method, comparing it with PINN (or PIRL).
   The Ablation Study subfolder contains experiments with the addition of hidden, layer, and epochs to PINN.
   More equations satisfying martingale properties have achieved better numerical results under the M-PINN method, demonstrating the broad applicability of M-PINN.
